In the narrative, characters such as Scrooge and a gentleman mention prisons as part of the broader social system that addresses poverty, highlighting how society often confines its vulnerable members rather than providing support. Additionally, the Spirit refers to prisons as places of confinement, using them rhetorically to challenge the neglect and mistreatment of those in need.
