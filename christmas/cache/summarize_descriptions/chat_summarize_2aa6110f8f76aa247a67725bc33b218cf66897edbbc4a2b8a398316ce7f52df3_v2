Initially, he is known for his strong disdain for Christmas, dismissing it as a time for fools and frequently complaining about its effects. He famously refers to Christmas as a \"humbug,\" reflecting his cynical and negative attitude toward the holiday. Despite this, Christmas remains the central event around which Scrooge's memories and experiences revolve, evoking powerful emotions and reflections throughout the narrative. Over time, Scrooge undergoes a profound transformation, ultimately embracing the spirit of Christmas. He vows to honor the holiday in his heart and life, demonstrating a newfound appreciation and warmth. This change is evident in his actions, as he begins to celebrate Christmas with Bob Cratchit and others, showing generosity and kindness.
