The holiday evokes deep emotions and memories for key characters such as Scrooge and the Ghost, highlighting themes of generosity, redemption, and goodwill. Throughout the story, Christmas is portrayed as a time of charity, kindness, and reflection, contrasting with Scrooge’s initial negative view of the holiday.
