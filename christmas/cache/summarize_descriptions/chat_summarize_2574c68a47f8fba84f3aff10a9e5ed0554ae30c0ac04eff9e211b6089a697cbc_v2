Marley, who died seven years prior, is a significant figure connected to Scrooge's life and the Christmas seasons. His ghostly face notably appears on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing the haunting influence Marley continues to have over him. Marley’s presence is not only physical but also psychological, as Scrooge is haunted by visions of Marley’s ghost, including the image of his pigtail, which lingers in Scrooge’s thoughts.
