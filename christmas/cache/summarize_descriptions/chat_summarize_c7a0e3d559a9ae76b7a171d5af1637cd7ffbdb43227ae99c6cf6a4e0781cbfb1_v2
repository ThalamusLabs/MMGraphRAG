These spectral visitations serve to enlighten Scrooge about the consequences of his actions and the importance of compassion. The second entity is the apparition or spirit of Jacob Marley, Scrooge's deceased business partner, who appears to warn him about the afterlife and the necessity of charity and kindness. Marley's ghost initiates Scrooge's transformative journey by cautioning him about the dire fate that awaits if he does not change his ways.
