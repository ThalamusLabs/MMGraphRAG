He is a tight-fisted, covetous businessman who works in a counting-house in London and is the sole executor and friend of Marley, co-owner of the firm Scrooge and Marley. Scrooge is widely disliked, including by his own family, and is characterized by his frosty demeanor, indifference to human sympathy, and disdain for Christmas and its celebrations. He refuses to join in Christmas merriment, shuns charitable causes, and is unsympathetic to the poor, preferring to leave them to suffer rather than offer financial support. His cold personality is reflected in both his physical features and his behavior, and he is often described as grumpy, hard, and unfeeling, even being regarded as the \"\"Ogre\"\" of the Cratchit family.\n\nThe narrative follows Scrooge’s profound transformation after he is visited on Christmas Eve by the ghost of his former partner Marley and subsequently by three spirits: the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. Initially skeptical and cautious about these supernatural visitations, Scrooge is guided through a reflective and somber journey where he witnesses scenes from his own life, including memories of his lonely childhood, his youthful happiness at Fezziwig’s ball, and the gradual hardening of his heart over the years. He also observes the struggles of others, such as the Cratchit family, and is particularly moved by the frail health and hopeful spirit of Tiny Tim.\n\nThrough these visions, Scrooge confronts the consequences of his miserly ways, including the bleak future that awaits him if he does not change. He witnesses scenes of death, loneliness, and the plundering of belongings, which prompt deep reflection on his legacy and moral standing. The spirits’ lessons encourage him to embrace kindness, generosity, and human connection.\n\nBy the story’s end, Ebenezer Scrooge undergoes a remarkable transformation. He becomes generous and warm-hearted, showing newfound concern for others. He raises Bob Cratchit’s salary, becomes like a second father to Tiny Tim, and actively participates in Christmas celebrations, even inviting his nephew Fred to dinner. Scrooge’s change is symbolized by acts of kindness such as buying a large turkey for the Cratchit household and living by principles of goodwill and charity. He ultimately embodies the spirit of Christmas, demonstrating that redemption and personal growth are possible through compassion and generosity.\n\nIn summary, Ebenezer Scrooge is a complex character who evolves from a miserly, cold, and solitary man into a benevolent and joyful figure, illustrating themes of redemption, the importance of human connection, and the transformative power of Christmas.\",122\n114,JACOB,\"Jacob Marley is the deceased former business partner of Ebenezer Scrooge.
